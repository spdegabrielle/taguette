# Summary

A spin on the phrase "tag it!", [Taguette](http://taguette.fr/>) is a free and open source qualitative research tool that allows users to:

* Import PDFs, Word Docs (`.docx`), Text files (`.txt`), HTML, EPUB, MOBI, Open Documents (`.odt`), and Rich Text Files (`.rtf`).
* Highlight words, sentences, or paragraphs and tag them with the codes *you* create.
* (not yet) Group imported documents together (e.g. as 'Interview' or 'Lit Review').
* Export tagged documents, highlights for a specific tag, a list of tags with description and colors, and whole projects.

# Motivation

Qualitative methods generate rich, detailed research materials that leave individuals’ perspectives intact  as well as provide multiple contexts for understanding phenomenon under study. Qualitative methods are used by a wide range of fields, such as anthropology, education, nursing, psychology, sociology, and marketing. Qualitative data has a similarly wide range: observations, interviews, documents, audiovisual materials, and more.

However - the software options for qualitative researchers are either **far too expensive**, don't allow for the seminal method of highlighting and tagging materials, *or actually perform quantitative analysis*, just on text.

**It's not right or fair that qualitative researchers without massive research funds cannot afford the basic software to do their research.**

So, to bolster a fair and equitable entry into qualitative methods, we've made Taguette!
